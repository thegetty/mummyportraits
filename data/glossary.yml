These distinguishing styles help scholars to propose a rough chronology of Roman portraiture and art, as images with these coiffures appear on dated materials such as coins and busts."

  - id: "tunic"
    display: "Tunic"
    definition: "A simple garment that covered the upper body, starting at the shoulders and ending at a length somewhere between the hips and the ankles. The English word *chiton* originates from the Latin *chiton*, which means “mollusk”; that, in turn, is derived from the Greek word *khitōn*, meaning “tunic.” The tunic was a basic garment worn by both men and women in ancient Rome. Citizens and noncitizens alike wore chitons (usually white for men and red for women). Citizens might wear a chiton under the toga, especially on formal occasions. The length of the garment and the presence or lack of stripes (*clavi*), as well as their width and ornamentation, indicated the wearer’s status in Roman society."

  - id: "UVF/UVL"
    display: "Ultraviolet-induced visible fluorescence (UVF) / UV-visible fluorescence / Ultraviolet-induced visible luminescence (UVL) (historically UV/VisFL)"
    definition: "An imaging technique and diagnostic examination method, based on characteristic responses of materials to ultraviolet (UV) radiation (185–400 nm) in the form of fluorescence, in which radiant energy in the UV region is absorbed and then reemitted as lower-energy visible light. The fluorescences revealed by the technique are used to assist in the general characterization or differentiation of materials—such as pigments, coatings, binders, and adhesives—and to diagnose the condition of an object (e.g., to detect restorations). The term *luminescence* also encompasses the possibility of a phosphorescent response to UV radiation in which there is a delay in the reemission of the absorbed energy by some materials, so that emission might even continue for a period after the UV excitation source is turned off. Because fluorescence is by far the dominant phenomenon being observed and documented, the term *fluorescence* has historically been used in describing this technique in conservation (as well as in medicine, nondestructive testing, and forensics); however, *luminescence* is an equally appropriate descriptor. "

  - id: "UVR/RUV"
    display: "Ultraviolet reflectance or ultraviolet reflected (UVR) imaging / reflected ultraviolet (RUV) imaging"
    definition: "An imaging technique that records variations in reflection and absorption of ultraviolet (UV) radiation by the surface of a subject. This imaging technique primarily aids in the characterization or differentiation of materials. Also because UV radiation exhibits very limited surface penetration, the technique can also help in characterizing surface sheen."

  - id: "umber"
    display: "Umbers (raw and burnt umber)"
    definition: "Natural earth pigments containing iron and manganese oxides and hydroxides. Used throughout history as earth tone pigments, umbers range in color from cream to brown, depending on the amount of iron and manganese present. Chemical formula: Iron (III) oxide, partly hydrated + manganese oxide, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>(·H<sub>2</sub>O) + MnO<sub>2</sub>·(nH<sub>2</sub>O)"

  - id: "VIL"
    display: "Visible-induced infrared luminescence / visible-induced luminescence (VIL)"
    definition: "An imaging technique in which visible light is used to induce the emission of infrared radiation (primarily in the near-infrared [NIR] region [700–1100 nm]) by certain materials. It has been used to identify historical blue pigments (principally Egyptian blue, Han blue, and Han purple) as well as many cadmium pigments and some natural dyes. These materials may show a very strong IR emission when excited by visible light. The setup for this type of imaging requires an excitation source emitting only visible light with no IR component, an imager with sensitivity to NIR (such as an IR-modified digital camera), and a lens filter that absorbs all visible light and transmits NIR. "

  - id: "VIVL"
    display: "Visible-induced visible luminescence (VIVL)"
    definition: "A method of recording a photo-induced emission of light in the visible region (500–700 nm) when the object is illuminated within a narrow band of visible light of higher energy (400–500 nm). The technique involves careful control of the spectra of the illuminating excitation source and imager lens filtration to limit the spectrum recorded only to the lower energy band of visible light."

  - id: "wreath"
    display: "Wreath"
    definition: "An assortment of flowers, leaves, fruits, twigs, or other materials constructed to resemble a loop. Typically worn on the head in ceremonial events, wreaths have much history and symbolism associated with them. In the Greco-Roman world, wreaths were used as adornments that could represent a person’s occupation, rank, achievements, or status."

  - id: "x-radiography"
    display: "X-radiography"
    definition: "An imaging technique used to reveal the internal structure of an object by using X-rays to record variations in the densities of its constituent materials. X-rays are transmitted, absorbed, or scattered in varying degrees by the materials present; the radiation that passes through the object is then captured on photographic film or a digital receptor placed behind the subject, thereby creating the radiograph. Dense materials and/or those containing elements of high atomic number, such as metal and lead white paint, strongly absorb X-rays and will appear white or light in tone; less dense materials, such as wood or other organic matter, readily transmit radiation and appear dark in the resulting image."

  - id: "XRD"
    display: "X-ray diffraction (XRD)"
    definition: "An analytical method used to examine the crystallographic structure, composition, and physical properties of materials, such as mineral pigments."

  - id: "XRF/pXRF"
    display: "X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectroscopy"
    definition: "Techniques used for nondestructive elemental analyses of inorganic materials, utilizing a focused beam of X-rays to excite the atoms on the surface of an artwork and measuring the emitted energy. These emissions provide characteristic fingerprints of the elements in the sampled area, allowing researchers to formulate hypotheses about the compounds contained therein."

  - id: "yellow ochre"
    display: "Yellow ochre"
    definition: "A naturally occurring mineral consisting of silica and clay. Its yellow color is attributed to the mineral goethite. Found throughout the world, yellow ochre has many shades and hues. Chemical formula: Iron oxyhydroxide, FeO(OH)"
