    bio: "Marie Svoboda is a conservator in the antiquities conservation department at the J. Paul Getty Museum. She received an MA from the art conservation department at the State University of New York, Buffalo, where she majored in artifacts and minored in paintings conservation. Svoboda worked as an assistant conservator of ancient materials at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, before joining the Getty. She is actively involved in the planning and installation of special exhibitions and loans, international collaborations, and various in-depth studies on conservation and technical research. A special interest in Romano-Egyptian material culminated in the publication of the book *Herakleides: A Portrait Mummy from Roman Egypt* (Getty Publications, 2011) and sparked the APPEAR project, the international collaboration on the study of ancient panel paintings that resulted in the research presented in this volume."
