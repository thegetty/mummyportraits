  one_line: Presenting fascinating new findings on ancient Romano-Egyptian funerary portraits preserved in international collections
  full: |
    Once interred with mummified remains, nearly a thousand funerary portraits from Roman Egypt survive today in museums and galleries around the world, bringing viewers face-to-face with people who lived two thousand years ago. Until recently, few of these paintings had undergone in-depth study to determine how they were made.

    An international collaboration known as APPEAR (Ancient Panel Paintings: Examination, Analysis, and Research) was launched in 2013 to promote the study of these objects and to gather scientific and historical findings into a shared database. The first phase of the project was marked with a two-day conference at the Getty Villa. Conservators, scientists, and curators presented new research on topics such as provenance and collecting, comparisons of works across institutions, and scientific studies of pigments, binders, and supports. The papers and posters from the conference are collected in this publication, which offers the most up-to-date information available about these fascinating remnants of the ancient world..

    bio: "Marie Svoboda is a conservator in the antiquities conservation department at the J. Paul Getty Museum. She received an MA from the Art cCnservation Department at the State University of New York, Buffalo, where she majored in artifacts and minored in paintings conservation. Svoboda worked as an assistant conservator of ancient materials at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, before joining the Getty. She is actively involved in the planning and installation of special exhibitions and loans, international collaborations, and various in-depth studies on conservation and technical research. A special interest in Romano-Egyptian material culminated in the publication of the book *Herakleides: A Portrait Mummy from Roman Egypt* (Getty Publications, 2011) and sparked the APPEAR project, the international collaboration on the study of ancient panel paintings that resulted in the research presented in this volume."
