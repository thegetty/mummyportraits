        - (E) Purple paint from drapery on portrait in fig. 3.1

      Samples prepared by reacting with approximately 5 percent boron trifluoride in methanol. Vertical scales adjusted individually; actual peak heights are indicated. Compounds plotted: alizarin (m/z 239), purpurin (m/z 255), methyl ester of pseudopurpurin (m/z 313). Instrumental conditions were different for (E), which resulted in shifted retention times.
